<h1>Heroes III: Might & Magic Structures</h1>
<h2>Learn about every structure and how to use it efficiently</h2>

<h3>Portals</h3>
<p>Portals are major part of the game. Some are one-way others are two-way(Be careful when using the one-way though it can put you in very sticky situation!) while others take you to the lower/higher level of the earth.

<h4>Two-way monoliths</h4>

<p>Normally in the game you will 100% find atleast one of the this portals. They have different color(Green/Blue and rarely yellow) and shape(small % big) but there isnt much of a difference between them. They are connected to the same tipe of monolith(small green connects to small green, ect.). If there are more than 2 of the same tipe that means you can teleport to the others aswell(Press "space button" when on your hero is on the monolith). Monolits can take you to the other level of the earth as well, but it is different than 'Subterranean gate' because it wont be transport you to the exact same cordinates on the map in the lower/upper part of the earth.

<h4>One-way monoliths</h4>

<p>Usually in the game you will find atleast one of the this portals as well. They have different color(Dashing yellow/Red and rarely with Blue dots on black background) and shape(small % big) but the difference is that only the entrance will glow, the exit is always black with only the apearance of the monolith. They are connected to the same tipe of monolith(small red connects to small red, ect.), but you cannot go back once you enter, They do share in common the connection between more than two which means if you enter second time it probably wont be the same lacation as the first try. This Monolits can take you to the other level of the earth as well but be careful when you use them with your main hero because they can place you on the other side of the map and leave you town without its main deffence agains enemies. </p>

<h4>Subterranean gate</h4>
<p>This tipe of portal will lead you straight to the lower/upper part of the earth(map).They transports you to the exact same place every time and its location is always connected to the same location in the other level of the map</p>

<h4>Obelisks</h4>
<p>This stone statues can be found all over the map in differet locations. They give you pieces of information on where the 'Holy Grail' is located. I strongly advice you to collect them before your enemies do. The grail is the most poweful item you can probably find in this game and it is considered over powered by the community because of the stats and gold it gives to your town and heroes</p>

<h4>School of Magic</h4>
<p>This brown sparcling tower will give you a one of the 'Power' or 'Knowledge' stat on your choosing but it cost 1000g</p>

<h4>School of War</h4>
<p>This yellow fortres will give you a one of the 'Attack' or 'Deffence' stat on your choosing but it cost 1000g</p>

<h4>Arena</h4>
<p>This coleseium will give you a two of the 'Attack' or 'Deffence' stat on your choosing for free</p>

<h4>Learning Stone</h4>
<p>This statue will give you a 1000 experience once per hero for free</p>
